   Schematic of the Variational System Identification.
	 
Description
===========
The system identification workflow uses a class of inverse modeling techniques that allows physics discovery from data. 

Examples
========

Example 1: Pattern formation
----------------------------
The example used here is identifying the governing equation of Turing pattern physics. The data and the bases in weak form are generated by MechanoChemFEM.

Data preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The data are generated by the coupled diffusion-reaction equations for two species following Schnakenberg kinetics. For an activator-inhibitor species pair, these equations use auto-inhibition with cross-activation of a short range species, and auto-activation with cross-inhibition of a long range species to form so-called Turing patterns. The bases are also pre-calculated and save in the datasets, therefore in this example the data can be directly loaded from the data set. Please refer to Examples at MechanoChemFEM for details. 

Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Standard parameters in the workflow can be defined in the .ini configuration file.

Plaese use "python main.py config_Example1.ini" to run the problem with the configuration file.
